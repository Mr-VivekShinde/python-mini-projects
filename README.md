# python-mini-projects

This repository contains a collection of mini python project which I have created while learning and improving my python skills.
Each project focuses on strengthening fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, functions, lists,tuples, if-else,dictionaries,sets, user input, logic building etc.

The projects are organized into folders so you can easily explore and run each one.
Most program's scripts are short. Each program is of diiferent kind. I belive they are great examples of simple and beginner-friendly coding practise.


What’s inside?
- Basic syntax exercises
- Logical challenges
- Problem-solving tasks


Each sub-folder typically includes:
- main.py — The Python script
- README.md — Short explanation of the project and how to run it.


Requirement:
- Make sure python installed on your machine.
- You need a code editor
