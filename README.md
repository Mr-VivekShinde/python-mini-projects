# python-mini-projects
This repository contains a collection of small Python programs which I have created while learning and improving my Python skills.
Each project focuses on fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, user input,simple logic building etc.

The projects are organized into folders so you can easily explore and run each one.
Most program's scripts are short. Each program is of diiferent theam. I belive they are great examples of simple and beginner-friendly coding.

What’s inside?

    Basic syntax exercises
    Logical challenges
    Problem-solving tasks

Each sub-folder typically includes:

    main.py — The Python script
    README.md — Short explanation of the project and how to run it.

Requirement:

    Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
    You need a Code editor.
